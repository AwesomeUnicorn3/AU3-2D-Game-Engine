# AU3 Engine 
A quick way to prototype 2D games
plug-in for Godot

This plug-in is in very early stages. The database manager works but there is currently no information on how to use it inside a project. 
My ultimate goal is to make something similar to rpg maker (database side, not level design)
On twitter my pinned thread are progress updates and videos showing how to use new features @Mi5ta_F
